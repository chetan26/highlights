## Vision

Cornerstone brings best-in class learning to our learners.

Learners have the opportunity to learn and consume content in a variety of devices/formats.

How does Cornerstone help the learner after the learner completes content ?

...

What value do we bring after content completion ?

## Retention

The worst-best-case scenario is all too familiar.....

- Learner finds exactly what she is looking for
- Learner loves the content and engages with it
- Learner learns much about the subject

A few weeks later...
- Learner does not remember much of what she had learnt.
- Knowledge retention seems to follow the Power law. 
- It decreases as the square of time.

##To start UI
Open command prompt from following folder: 
	angularclient > ng serve --open

## Personal Experience
```
I started off learning React.
2 production issues cropped up
Had to also continue on a sprint delivery story that was slightly complicated.

When I did get back to React, it felt a few years had passed.
Was pretty dis-oriented and had to start from scratch again.
