<h2>Bayes classifier for your books</h2>

<!-- blog post begin -->
<p>
I knew about dbacl -- a simple Bayes classifier, that can classify small texts.
See <a href="http://dbacl.sourceforge.net/tutorial-1.html">the short tutorial</a>.
Basically, it was used for filtering spam, but can also categorize your email, like gmail does ('Social', 'Promotions', etc).
</p>

<p>
But I wanted to classify my books library, which is in PDF/DJVU/EPUB/MOBI form, but also available in text form, see:
<a href="https://yurichev.com/news/20210403_search_engine/">my blog post about it</a>.
</p>

<p>How would I classify it? Maybe I could use some books as references and compare other books with 'referenced books'?</p>

<p>
But I came up with a more hackish idea -- I can use Wikipedia as a source of categorized texts.
Why not?
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://yurichev.com/tmp/dbacl/get_wikipedia_dumps.sh">Let's get the latest Wikipedia dump.</a>
</p>

<p>
I'm passing all the XML dumps through
<a href="https://yurichev.com/tmp/dbacl/process_wikipedia_dump.py">my tiny Python script.</a>
It only sorts wikipedia articles by categories.
So if a text X has '[[Category:Y]]' and '[[Category:Z]]' at the bottom, my script would append this text
to two files: Y and Z.
At the end, a file Y would contain text of all articles in this category.
</p>

<p>
The resulting text files are huge.
If you want to repeat my steps, you can get them:
<a href="https://yurichev.com/tmp/dbacl/enwiki_categories_texts.7z">(beware - 10GB)</a>.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://yurichev.com/tmp/dbacl/run_dbacl_prepare.sh">Then I extracted all the features from each category using dbacl.</a>
</p>

<p>
Again, if you want to get all the files processed by dbacl, here are:
<a href="https://yurichev.com/tmp/dbacl/dbacl_processed.7z">(1GB)</a>.
</p>

<p>
Now the problem.
dbacl from the default Ubuntu 20.* package supports only 256 categories, but I wanted much more.
Sadly, dbacl is not maintained actively, so it wouldn't compile, I'm getting an error
<a href="https://bugs.gentoo.org/689500">like that</a>.
</p>

<p>
So it's time to hack it a little.
In src/config.h I removed "#define HAVE_MBRTOWC 1".
I don't need Unicode anyway.
With a bit tinkering, I managed to extend max categories to 10000:
<a href="https://yurichev.com/tmp/dbacl/dbacl-1.14.1.patch">patch</a>.
But no more -- some global arrays would be bigger than compiler's limits otherwise...
So I removed many smaller Wikipedia categories, and only ~10k are left, that have largest texts.
(In other words, only ~10k most popular categories are left.)
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://yurichev.com/tmp/dbacl/dbacl-1.14.1-patched-and-compiled.tar.bz2">Patched and compiled version of dbacl for Linux.</a>
</p>

<p>
OK, now I can pass all my library through.
<a href="https://yurichev.com/tmp/dbacl/run_dbacl_check.sh">This script</a>
prepares a command line for dbacl by enumerating all categories.
</p>

<p>
A command line can be huge, up to 0.5MB (all ~10k categories are listed here)!
<a href="https://yurichev.com/tmp/dbacl/example_command_line_for_dbacl.sh">Example.</a>
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://yurichev.com/tmp/dbacl/run_dbacl_for_book.sh">This script run dbacl with this huge command line for a book.</a>
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://yurichev.com/tmp/dbacl/run_dbacl_for_all_books.sh">This script run it for all books in my collection, sorting them into categories.</a>
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, dbacl is painfully slow (keep in mind ~10k categories).
I waited almost a week to get my library processed.
4 CPU cores has been busy all the time and 4 dbacl instances used ~10GB of RAM.
<p>

<p>
<a href="https://yurichev.com/tmp/dbacl/my-library.txt">But the results are fun!</a>
</p>

<p>
All the system is far from perfect, but it performs surprisingly well!
Math books went to 'Articles_containing_proofs', many programming books went to 'Articles_with_example_C_code', 'Articles_with_example_code', etc.
</p>

<p>
One fun thing is that many fiction books went to a 'Wikipedia_Reference_Desk_archive' category.
What is this?
Ah, these are Wikipedia pages with many chats and dialogues:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reference_desk">"The Wikipedia reference desk works like a library reference desk. Ask a question here and Wikipedia volunteers will try to answer it."</a>
</p>

<p>
Probably, this category is better to be removed.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://yurichev.com/tmp/dbacl/gutenberg.txt">Then I processed many books from the Gutenberg library.</a>
Far from perfect, but not bad either!
</p>

<p>
In my opinion, though it's very slow, it's practically usable.
</p>

<p>
Further work: a set of categories may be much better, prepared manually.
Also, a script can print several categories for each text.
</p>

<p>
P.S.
Also fun story:
<a href="http://dbacl.sourceforge.net/spam_chess-1.html">"Can a Bayesian spam filter play chess?"</a>
