<p>While the adoption of <a href="http://openpgp.org/">OpenPGP</a>
 by the general population is marginal at
best, it is a critical component for the security community and
particularly for Linux distributions. For example, every package
uploaded into Debian is verified by the central repository using the
maintainer's OpenPGP keys and the
repository itself is, in turn, signed 
using a separate key. If upstream packages also use such signatures, this
creates 
a complete trust path from the original upstream developer to
users.
Beyond that, pull requests for the Linux kernel are verified using
 signatures as well.
Therefore, the stakes are high: a compromise of the release key, or
even of a single maintainer's key, could enable devastating
attacks against many machines.</p>

<p>That has led the Debian community to develop a good grasp of
best practices for cryptographic signatures (which are typically handled using <a
href="http://gnupg.org/">GNU Privacy Guard</a>, also known as GnuPG or
GPG). For example, weak (less than 2048 bits) and <a
href="/Articles/588266/">vulnerable</a> PGPv3  
keys were <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/20150101191039.GB5209@earth.li">removed</a>
from the keyring in 2015, and there is a strong
culture of cross-signing keys between Debian members at in-person
meetings. Yet even Debian developers (DDs) do not seem to have established
practices on how to actually store critical private key material, as
we can see in this <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2017/08/msg00011.html">discussion</a>
on the debian-project mailing list.  That email
boiled down to a simple request: can I have a "key dongles for
dummies" tutorial? Key dongles, or keycards as we'll call them here,
are small devices that allow users to store keys on an offline
device and provide one possible solution for protecting private key
material. In this article, I hope to use my experience in this domain to 
clarify the issue of how to store those precious private keys that, if
compromised, could
enable arbitrary code execution on millions of machines all over the
world.</p>

<h4>Why store keys offline?</h4>

<p>Before we go into details about storing keys offline, it may be
useful to do a small reminder of how the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880">OpenPGP standard</a> works.
OpenPGP keys are made of a main public/private key pair, the
certification key, used to sign user identifiers and subkeys. My
public key, shown below, has the usual main certification/signature key (marked
<code>SC</code>) but also an encryption subkey (marked <code>E</code>), a separate signature
key (<code>S</code>), and two authentication keys (marked <code>A</code>)
which I use as RSA 
keys to log into servers using SSH, thanks to the <a
href="http://monkeysphere.info/">Monkeysphere</a> 
project.</p>

</pre>

<p>All the subkeys (<code>sub</code>) and identities (<code>uid</code>) are
bound by the main 
certification key using cryptographic self-signatures. So while an
attacker stealing a private subkey can spoof signatures in my name or
authenticate to other servers, that key can always be revoked by the
main certification key. But if the certification key gets stolen, all
bets are off: the attacker can create or revoke identities or subkeys
as they wish. In a catastrophic scenario, an attacker could even steal
the key and remove your copies, taking complete control of the key,
without any possibility of recovery. Incidentally, this is why it is
so important to generate a revocation certificate and store it
offline.</p>

<p>So by moving the certification key offline, we reduce the attack
surface on the OpenPGP trust chain: day-to-day keys (e.g. email
encryption or signature) can stay online but if they get stolen, the
certification key can revoke those keys without having to revoke the
main certification key as well. Note that a stolen encryption key is a
different problem: even if we revoke the encryption subkey, this will
only affect future encrypted messages. Previous messages <em>will</em> be
readable by the attacker with the stolen subkey even if that subkey
gets revoked, so the benefits of revoking encryption certificates are
more limited.</p>

<h4>Common strategies for offline key storage</h4>

<p>Considering the security tradeoffs, some propose storing those
critical keys offline to reduce those threats. But where exactly? In
an attempt to answer that question, Jonathan McDowell, a member of
the <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/KeyringMaint">Debian keyring maintenance team</a>, said that there are <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2017/08/msg00054.html">three
options</a>: use  an external LUKS-encrypted
volume, an air-gapped system, or a keycard.</p>

<p>Full-disk encryption like LUKS adds an extra layer of security by hiding
the content of the key from an attacker. Even though private keyrings are
usually protected by a passphrase, they are easily
identifiable as a keyring. But when a volume is fully encrypted, it's not
immediately 
obvious to an attacker there is private key material on the device. <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2017/08/msg00148.html">According</a>
to Sean Whitton, another advantage of LUKS over plain GnuPG keyring
encryption is that you can pass the <code>--iter-time</code> argument when
creating a LUKS partition to increase key-derivation delay, which makes
brute-forcing much harder.
Indeed, GnuPG&nbsp;2.x <a
href="https://dev.gnupg.org/T3400">doesn't have</a> a run-time option to
configure the 
key-derivation algorithm, although a <a
href="https://dev.gnupg.org/T3399">patch</a> was introduced recently to
make 
the delay configurable at compile
time in <tt>gpg-agent</tt>, which is now responsible for all secret key
operations.

<p>
The downside of external volumes is complexity: GnuPG
makes it difficult to extract secrets out of its keyring, which
makes the first setup tricky and error-prone.
This is easier in the 2.x series thanks to the new storage system and the
associated <tt>keygrip</tt> files, but it still requires arcane knowledge
of GPG internals.  
It is also inconvenient to
use secret keys stored outside your main keyring when you actually <i>do</i>
need to use them, as GPG doesn't know where to find those keys anymore.</p>

<p>Another option is to set up a separate air-gapped system to perform
certification operations. An example is the <a
href="https://wiki.debian.org/OpenPGP/CleanRoomLiveEnvironment">PGP
clean room</a> project, which is a live system based on Debian and designed
by DD Daniel Pocock to operate an OpenPGP and X.509
certificate authority using commodity hardware. The basic principle is to
store the secrets on a different machine that is never connected to the network
and, therefore, not exposed to attacks, at least in theory. I have
personally discarded that approach because I feel air-gapped systems
provide a false sense of security: data eventually does need to come in and
out of the system, somehow, even if only to propagate signatures out of the
system, which exposes the system to attacks.

<p>
System updates are similarly
problematic: to keep the system secure, timely security updates need to be
deployed to the air-gapped system. A common use pattern is to share data
through USB keys, which introduce a vulnerability where attacks like <a
href="/Articles/608503/">BadUSB</a> can infect the air-gapped system. From
there, there is a multitude of exotic ways of exfiltrating the data using
<a
href="https://threatpost.com/blinking-router-leds-leak-data-from-air-gapped-networks/126199/">LEDs</a>,
<a
href="http://thehackernews.com/2017/09/airgap-network-malware-hacking.html">infrared
cameras</a>, or the good old <a
href="https://www.wired.com/2015/07/researchers-hack-air-gapped-computer-simple-cell-phone/">TEMPEST</a>
attack. I therefore concluded the complexity tradeoffs of an air-gapped
system are not worth it. Furthermore, the workflow for air-gapped systems
is complex: even though PGP clean room went a long way, it's still lacking
even simple scripts that allow signing or transferring keys, which is a problem shared by the external LUKS storage approach.</p>

<h4>Keycard advantages</h4>

<p>The approach I have chosen is to use a cryptographic keycard: an
external device, usually connected through the USB port, that stores
the private key material and performs critical cryptographic
operations on the behalf of the host. For example, the <a href="http://www.gniibe.org/FST-01/fst-01.html">FST-01 keycard</a>
can perform RSA and ECC public-key decryption without ever exposing
the private key material to the host. In effect, a keycard is a
miniature computer that performs restricted computations for another
host. Keycards usually support multiple "slots" to store subkeys. The
OpenPGP standard specifies there are three subkeys available by default:
for signature, authentication, and encryption. Finally, keycards can
have an actual physical keypad to enter passwords so a potential
keylogger cannot capture them, although the keycards I have access to
do not feature such a keypad.</p>

<p>We could easily draw a parallel between keycards and an air-gapped
system; in effect, a keycard is a miniaturized air-gapped computer and
suffers from similar problems.  An attacker can intercept data on the host
system and attack the device in the same way, if not more easily,
because a keycard is actually "online" (i.e. clearly not air-gapped) when
connected. The advantage 
over a fully-fledged air-gapped computer, however, is that the keycard
implements 
only a restricted set of operations. So it is easier to create an open
hardware and software design that is audited and verified,
which is much harder to accomplish for a general-purpose computer.</p>

<p>Like air-gapped systems, keycards address the scenario where an
attacker wants to get the private key material. While an
attacker could fool the keycard into signing or decrypting some
data, this is possible only while the key is physically connected,
and the keycard software will prompt the user for a password before
doing the operation, though the keycard can cache the password for some time. In effect, it thwarts offline attacks: to
brute-force the key's password, the attacker needs to be on the target
system and try to guess the keycard's password, which will lock itself after a
limited number of tries. It also provides for a clean and standard
interface to store keys offline: a single GnuPG command moves private
key material to a keycard (the <code>keytocard</code> command in the
<code>--edit-key</code> 
interface), whereas moving private key material to a LUKS-encrypted
device or air-gapped computer is more complex.</p>

<p>Keycards are also useful if you operate on multiple computers. A
common problem when using GnuPG on multiple machines is how to safely
copy and synchronize private key material among different devices, which
introduces new security problems. Indeed, a "<span>good rule of
thumb in a forensics lab</span>", <a
href="https://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnupg-users/2017-April/058050.html">according</a>
to Robert J. Hansen on the GnuPG mailing list, is to "<span>store the minimum
personal data possible on your 
systems</span>". Keycards provide the best of both worlds here: you can use
your private key on multiple computers without actually storing it in
multiple places. In fact,  Mike Gerwitz went as far
as <a href="https://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnupg-users/2017-April/058068.html">saying</a>:</p>

<div class="BigQuote">
  <p>For users that need their GPG key on multiple boxes, I consider a
  smartcard to be essential. Otherwise, the user is just furthering
  her risk of compromise.</p>
</div>



<h4>Keycard tradeoffs</h4>

<p>As Gerwitz hinted, there are multiple downsides to using a keycard,
however. Another 
DD, Wouter Verhelst clearly <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2017/08/msg00020.html ">expressed</a> the
tradeoffs:</p>

<div class="BigQuote">
  <p>Smartcards are useful. They ensure that the private half of your key
  is never on any hard disk or other general storage device, and
  therefore that it cannot possibly be stolen (because there's only
  one possible copy of it).</p>
  
  <p>Smartcards are a pain in the ass. They ensure that the private half
  of your key is never on any hard disk or other general storage
  device but instead sits in your wallet, so whenever you need to
  access it, you need to grab your wallet to be able to do so, which
  takes more effort than just firing up GnuPG. If your laptop doesn't
  have a builtin cardreader, you also need to fish the reader from
  your backpack or wherever, etc.</p>
</div>

<p>
"Smartcards" here refer to older <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenPGP_card">OpenPGP cards</a> that
relied on 
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_7816">IEC 7816 smartcard connectors</a> and therefore needed a
specially-built smartcard reader. Newer keycards simply use a
standard USB connector. In any case, it's true that having an external
device introduces new issues: 
attackers can steal your keycard, you can simply lose it, or
wash it with your dirty laundry. A laptop or a computer can also be lost, of
course, but it is much easier to lose a small USB keycard than a full
laptop — and I have yet to hear of someone shoving a full laptop into a
washing machine. When you lose your keycard, unless a separate
revocation certificate is available somewhere, you lose complete
control of the key, which is
catastrophic. But, even if you revoke the lost key, you need to create
a new one, which involves rebuilding the web of trust for the key —
a rather expensive operation as it usually requires meeting other
OpenPGP users in person to exchange fingerprints.</p>

<p>You should therefore think about how to back up the certification key,
which is a problem that already exists for online keys; of course, everyone
has a revocation certificates and backups of their OpenPGP
keys... right?  In the keycard scenario, backups may be multiple
keycards distributed geographically.

<p> Note that, contrary to an air-gapped system, a key generated on a
keycard <em>cannot</em> be backed up, by design. For subkeys, this is not a
problem as they do not need to be backed up (except encryption keys). But,
for a certification key, this means users need to generate the key on the
host and transfer it to the keycard, which means the host is expected to
have enough entropy to generate cryptographic-strength random numbers, for
example. Also consider the 
possibility of combining different approaches: you could, for example, use
a keycard 
for day-to-day operation, but keep a backup of the certification key on a
LUKS-encrypted offline volume.</p>

<p>Keycards introduce a new element into the trust chain: you need to
trust the keycard manufacturer to not have  any hostile code
in the key's firmware or hardware. In addition, you need to trust that the
implementation is correct. Keycards are harder to update: the
firmware may be deliberately inaccessible to the host for security
reasons or may require special software to manipulate. Keycards may
be slower than the CPU in performing certain operations because they are
small embedded microcontrollers with limited computing power.</p>

<p>Finally, keycards may <em>encourage</em> users to trust multiple machines
with their secrets, which works against the "minimum personal data"
principle. A completely different approach called the <a href="http://cmrg.fifthhorseman.net/wiki/TrustedPhysicalConsole">trusted physical console</a> (TPC) does the opposite: instead of trying to get private key material onto all of
those machines, just have them on a single machine that is used
for everything. Unlike a keycard, the TPC is 
an actual computer, say a laptop, which has the advantage of needing no special procedure to manage
keys. The downside is, of course, that you actually need to carry that
laptop everywhere you go, which may be problematic, especially in some
corporate environments that restrict bringing your own devices.</p>

<h4>Quick keycard "howto"</h4>

<p>Getting keys onto a keycard is easy enough:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Start with a temporary key to test the procedure:</p>

<pre>
    export GNUPGHOME=$(mktemp -d)
    gpg --generate-key
</pre></li>
<li>
<p>Edit the key using its <a
    href="https://manpages.debian.org/unstable/gpg/gpg.1.en.html#HOW_TO_SPECIFY_A_USER_ID">user
    ID</a> (UID):</p>

<pre>
    gpg --edit-key <i>UID</i>
</pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the <tt>key</tt> command to
    select the first subkey, then copy it to 
the keycard (you can also use the <code>addcardkey</code> command to just
generate a new subkey directly on the keycard):</p>

<pre>
    gpg&gt; key 1
    gpg&gt; keytocard
</pre>
</li>
<li><p>If you want to <em>move</em> the subkey, use the <code>save</code>
    command, which 
    will remove the local copy of the private key, so the keycard
will be the <em>only</em> copy of the secret key. Otherwise use the
    <code>quit</code> 
command to save the key on the keycard, but
    keep the 
secret key in your normal keyring; answer "n" to "save changes?" and "y" to "quit without saving?" . This way the keycard is a
backup of your secret key.</p></li>
<li><p>Once you are satisfied with the results, repeat steps 1 through 4
with your normal keyring (unset <code>$GNUPGHOME</code>)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>When a key is moved to a keycard, <code>--list-secret-keys</code> will show it as
<code>sec&gt;</code> (or <code>ssb&gt;</code> for subkeys) instead of the usual <code>sec</code> keyword. If
the key is completely missing (for example, if you moved it to a LUKS
container), the <code>#</code> sign is used instead. If you need to use a key
from a keycard backup, you simply do <code>gpg&nbsp;--card-edit</code> with
the key plugged in, 
then type the <code>fetch</code> command at the prompt to fetch the public key
that corresponds to the private key on the
keycard (which stays on the keycard). This is the same procedure as the one
to <a href="http://www.fsij.org/doc-gnuk/using-gnuk-token-with-another-computer.html">use the secret key on another computer</a>.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>There are already informal <a
href="https://riseup.net/en/security/message-security/openpgp/best-practices">OpenPGP
best-practices guides</a> out
there and some recommend storing keys offline, but they rarely
explain what exactly that means. Storing your primary secret key
offline is important in dealing with possible compromises and we
examined the main ways of doing so: either with an air-gapped system,
LUKS-encrypted keyring, or by using keycards. Each approach has its own
tradeoffs, but I recommend getting familiar with keycards if you use
multiple computers and want a standardized interface with minimal
configuration trouble.</p>

<p>And of course, those approaches can be combined. <a href="http://viccuad.me/blog/Revisited-secure-yourself-part-1-airgapped-computer-and-gpg-smartcards ">This tutorial</a>,
for example, uses a keycard on an air-gapped computer, which neatly
resolves the question of how to transmit signatures between the
air-gapped system and the world. It is definitely not for the faint of
heart, however.</p>

<p>
Once one has decided to use
a keycard, the next order of business is to choose a specific device.
That choice will be addressed in a followup article, where I will look at
performance, physical design, and other considerations.
